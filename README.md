It’s focuses on generating insights around gender pay gap, company’s salary structure, gender inequality and compliance with regulation, include bonus calculation using a second dataset on Power BI to build an interactive visuals dashboard with slicers and filter on the focuses Points Palmoria management team would need to address for business decision making.

### Tools used
- Power BI 
 - For Data Collection
 - For Data Transformation
 - Calculated columns
 - For Data Visualization
 - For Dashboard creations

### Data Transformation and preparation
In the initial phase of the Data Transformation and preparation, I perform the following actions;
- Assign a generic gender status to employees that refused to disclose their gender
- Renamed location as region
- I took out employees that are no longer with the company.  
- Departments indicated as “NULL” was also taken out.
- Merged Palmoria group emp_data and Palmoria group Bonus rules to a Table named Palmoria HR Emp_data by creating relationship between them.
- Addition of calculated column such as: Salary band, Annual bonus and Total pay.

### Key insights
-	Kaduna stands out as the most gender-balanced region.
-	Abuja has high presence of both genders (male and female) across all departments with a sightly male dominance in some department like legal and product management.
-	Lagos has sightly male dominance overall, a few departments like Support and training has significantly more males than females.
-	Employees in department like legal, support and sales appear prominently among top earners.
-	Bonus amount is heavily influenced by both salary level and the rating-based bonus percentage.
-	Palmoria meet the requirement that requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
-	Discoveries noticeable pay gap favoring males in several departments
-	The total number of employees below the minimum of $90,000 threshold for the recent regulation are 654 out of 946 employees.

### Recommendations
- Targeted Recruitment: Encourage hiring from underrepresented genders in specific departments (e.g., female in legal and male in research and development, engineering and training).
- Internal Mentorship: Foster gender diversity via mentorships in male - or female -heavy departments.
- Ongoing Monitoring: Track these metrics quarterly to identify trends or imbalance over time.

### Dashboard Building
- Created an interactive dashboard with Bar, pie, scatter, column charts, tables and slicers for:
  - Gender distribution distils to regions and departments in the organization
  - Insights on ratings based on gender 
  - Company’s salary structure on gender pay gap.
  - Pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000, visualized by regions
  - Total number of employees below minimum salary threshold
  - Amount of bonus to be paid to individual employees
  - Total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
  - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
  - Fitters for department, gender and region.

 ### What I learned

- How to designed user-friendly dashboard that answer real operational questions
